\chapter{Story and Setting}

\section{Story and Narrative}

Our setting is the Cinque National Bank (CNB), it is a prestigious and sophisticated bank frequented by the rich and known by thieves as a goldmine. Set in the near future, Cinque National Bank is notorious for their top of the line security and surveillance measures in addition to being loaded.  The bank is a complex building with a lot of hallways, rooms, and sections with state of the art defense and security mechanisms along with professional security drones. Although many thieves from all around the world have attempted to pull off heists, no one has been successful, so far. This time, however, four thieves plan to perform the biggest heist in history at Cinque National Bank, but little do they know, they are all there on the same night.

\subsection{Game Progression Summary}

Four thieves spawn at random at one of the four points of entry. In the first stage, their objective is to infiltrate the bank by getting past quicktime events to bypass traps and hazards. Secondly, they must now move through the bank to not get spotted by other players or security drones. 
Their next objective is to get to the vault and obtain as much gold as possible and more then the next player to win. After they need to obtain as much gold as possible from the bank, they have to escape through the bank from a randomly chosen escape point in the bank before the lockdown timer expires and they get stuck in the bank.

\section{Cut Scenes}

\chapter{Levels}

\section{Floor \#1}

\subsection{Synopsis}

The Ground Floor is the starting point for all characters. It contains the player spawn points. This floor has a lower number of pickups and obstacles than the Basement Floor. There are hazards and traps around, but very few in comparison to the lower level of the bank.

\subsection{Physical Description}

The map contains many shades of grey and dark colours such as azure blue and seaweed green. It’s viewed in a top-down, Isometric angle. The rooms present are offices, lobbies, meeting rooms, and bathrooms. They are all connected through a series of long hallways that will be filled with hazards and drones.

\subsubsection{Primary Path}

(Shown in Blue) The player spawns and makes their way directly down the stairs to the vault. This way is the fastest, but the players miss out on valuable pickups.

\subsubsection{Secondary Path}

(Shown in Magenta) The player spawns and looks around the bank for pickups. This way they gain an advantage against other players and drones, but it is not as fast as just going to the ground floor.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Encounters}

The player will encounter various challenges. The drones will attempt to stun them, and other players will be trying to prevent them from making it to the vault. There will also be various types of hazards that will slow the player down. The multiple Drones follow the yellow paths in opposite directions.

\subsection{Closing Material}

At the end of the game, the players will view a victory screen. The screen will show all four players as well as how much gold each player acquired. The players will be ranked in the order of how much gold they stole

\section{Floor \#2}

\subsection{Synopsis}

The basement floor is accessible through the staircases on the first floor. The basement contains a large amount of pickups and hazards - far more than the first floor. The vault is also located in the center of the basement. The players must go here to get the gold

\subsection{Physical Description}

The map contains many shades of grey and dark colours such as azure blue and seaweed green. It’s viewed in a top-down, Isometric angle. The rooms present are security rooms, more offices, storage rooms, and server rooms, in addition to the large gold vault.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Primary Path}

(Shown in Blue) The player gets down the stairs and immediately makes their way to the vault. This way is the fastest, but the players miss out on valuable pickups around the basement.

\subsubsection{Secondary Path}

(Shown in Magenta) The player gets down the stairs and looks around the basement for pickups. This way they gain an advantage against other players and drones, but it is not as fast as just going to the vault.

\subsection{Encounters}

The player will encounter various challenges. The drones will attempt to stun them, and other players will be trying to prevent them from making it to the vault. There will also be various types of hazards that will slow the player down. There will be far more hazards and drones in the basement. The multiple Drones follow the yellow path in opposite directions.

\chapter{User Interface}

\section{UI Layout}

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:uilayout}, the UI elements will appear on the corner of each respective player's screen. The elements shown in the UI are going to be:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Player Health}: Health is represented using the red bars
\item \textbf{Gold Score}: Score is represented above the health using numbers
\item \textbf{Character Profile}: A picture of the selected character
\item \textbf{Active Item}: An icon of the selected weapon/trap 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This will disappear if player doesn’t switch/use weapons/traps for 10 secs
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

\section{Audio}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Audio prompts will aid the players comprehension on when key events are happening in game
\end{itemize}

\section{Music}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Three general themes will be present, and be active once a certain stage in the game has passed:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Infiltration Phase
        \item Scavenging Phase
        \item Lockdown Phase
    \end{itemize}

        \item Victory Jingle
        \item Defeat Jingle
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Sound Effects}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sound effects will play depending on the situation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Picking up an object
        \item Placing a trap
        \item Succeed/fail a quicktime event
        \item Taking damage

        \item Close to a gold pile in the vault
    \end{itemize}
    \item Controls will be shown in the beginning of each match after the cutscene.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Artificial Intelligence}
\section{Enemy AI}

Drones

\begin{itemize}
    \item Patrols a set path until alerted and returns to the path once threat level returns to zero
    \item If it is alerted by a sound, the threat level becomes one and attempts to find the source of the sound
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It will go to the place the sound originated at, and once there begin a patrol of the area. Once patrol is complete and it doesn’t see anything, it’s threat level returns to zero and resumes it initial patrol.
    \end{itemize}
    \item If it sees a player, its threat level goes to two and attempts to follow and stun the player.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If it loses site of the player for 5 secs, the threat level becomes one, and it will begin to patrol the area.
        \item If the drone successfully stuns the player, it will pick up a portion of gold (if dropped) and return it to the vault. Once the gold has been returned, the threat level returns to zero and the initial patrol is resumed.
    \end{itemize}
    \item If the drone, while following or patrolling an area, moves beyond a set distance from its original patrol, it will disengage, set its threat level to zero and return to its original patrol.
    \item Once the lockdown has been activated, the drones will begin threat level three, where their patrol distance is increased and their speed is increased.    
\end{itemize}

\section{Pathfinding}

Uses the default Unity Navmesh Agent, setting the focused player’s as the Drone’s target. When returning to the vault all players are swapped to obstacles with width wide enough to block the hallway, so the drone’s pathfinding will avoid them.

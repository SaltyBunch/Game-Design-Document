\chapter{Game Overview}

\section{Game Concept}

Play as one of the four thieves attempting a heist on the Cinque National Bank. Players must infiltrate the bank, which is rigged with traps and hazards to challenge the player. Security Drones patrol the bank and will engage in combat with players if detected. Players will be able to use weapons and traps that are available as pickups across the map to engage in combat with other players or the drone. The main objective of the player is to reach the vault, then collect as much gold as possible from it, and then escape before the lockdown timer reaches zero. Player that escapes with the most gold possible wins, players who do not manage to escape before lockdown are not awarded points.

\section{Setting}

The game is set in the near future at the biggest bank in Europe, the Cinque National Bank. It is equipped with state-of-art defense technology, and is one of the most prestigious banks in the world.

\section{Game Progression}
Game Progression split into 3 parts

\subsection{Infiltration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Infiltration stage implies that the players must sneak in to the bank and make their way towards the basement.
    \item Infiltration stage will require players to be more stealthy
    \item Players can engage in combat
    \item Players will familiarize themselves with the environment and its challenges in this stage
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Scavenging}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This stage of the game blends between the other two stages
    \item Players will collect weapons and traps
    \item Players will set traps across the map for other players
    \item They will explore rooms and hallways for loot 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Lockdown}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This stage will be the most chaotic stage of the game
    \item As soon as a player accesses the vault, a lockdown timer initiates
    \item In this stage, players will be rushing and battling to gather as much gold as possible and try to escape the bank before lockdown.
    \item Only one exit will be available
    \item More traps and hazards will spawn
    \item Drones will be more aggressive
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}
\subsection{Main Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Achieve the highest score possible by collecting gold from the vault
    \item Escape before lockdown
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Secondary Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dodge and disable traps and hazards
    \item Collect weapons and traps
    \item Use weapons to engage in combat with players and/or drones
    \item Set pick-up-able traps
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges}
There are multiple challenges for the player
\subsection{Level Layout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Levels are not going to be straightforward paths towards the vault
    \item Levels will contain multiple paths, each with their own pros and cons
    \item Level of difficulty and frequency of pickups will vary area to area
    \item Hazards will already be set in the map at the beginning of the game
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Laser Tripwire: will inform enemy drones to the players position and send them to the player's area
        \item Electric Field: 
        \item Lethal Lasers: 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Hazards will be strategically set at areas of importance
    \item Some hazards can be disabled temporarily through a quick-time event
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If quick-time event is successful, trap is disabled for a short amount of time
        \item If quick-time event is failed, trap is triggered
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Drones}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Drones are the primary enemy for the players
    \item They patrol the bank, and will detect players in their vision radius
    \item Drones will attack the player if a player is detected
    \item Drones will be equipped with either of the following weapons
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stun Gun: ranged weapon that charges up before firing (dodgeable)
        \item Electric Field: AoE weapon that drones can deploy for short bursts, it deploys an electric field under them that will damage players that step in it. Drones will be faster and chase players around
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Play Flow}

\section{Mechanics}
\subsection{Physics}
\subsection{Movement}
\subsection{Score}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Score is calculated post game based on several factors. Either positively or negatively
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Positively
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The amount of gold removed from the bank
            \item Escaping from the bank before lockdown
        \end{itemize}
        \item Negatively
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The number of times the player has been stunned
            \item The amount of time taken to get in and out of the vault
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Objects}
\subsubsection{Traps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Traps can be found as pickups throughout the level based on a random spawning System
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Found scattered throughout the level, predominately found on the vault floor, but also on the ground floor
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weapons are found throughout the level, where worse weapons are found on the ground floor and better weapons are found on the vault floor
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Gold}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gold can be found in several places throughout the level
    \item At the beginning all gold will be in piles within the vault
    \item Gold within the vault can be picked up through an interaction that initiates a transfer between the gold pile and the player
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gold gets transferred at a fixed rate until the pile is empty or the player cancels
        \item Successfully completing quick-time events during the transfer increases the current rate of gold transfer
    \end{itemize}
    \item As players that have gold get damaged by players, drones and traps, their gold gets dropped on the ground
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These small piles of gold can be picked up simply by walking over them.
    \end{itemize}

\end{figure}

Play as one of the four thieves attempting the biggest heist in history on the Cinque National Bank. Players must infiltrate the bank which is rigged with state-of-the art defense systems to challenge the player. Security Drones will be patrolling the bank looking for any intruders.
The main objective for the player is to infiltrate the bank, gather as much gold as possible and escape the bank before lockdown. The thief who manages to escape with the most gold before lockdown wins the game.


\section{Setting}

The game is set in the near future at the Cinque National Bank. The CNB is the biggest and most prestigious bank in the world, equipped with high-level defense mechanisms due to its reputation and several failed attempts at a heist. Four of the best thieves in the world are attempting to successfully pull of the biggest heist in history. Unknown to them, they are not alone.

\section{General Features}

Heist will include a set of 4 unique playable characters whom players could choose from. Heist will be a multiplayer split-screen game with 3D isometric view of the pixelated voxel-style environment. Players will be able to engage in combat with each others or the security drones that patrol the bank and will engage players if they are detected. The bank is filled with defense mechanisms that the player has to either attempt to disable or work around.

The main objective of the game is for the player to be able to infiltrate the bank, gather equipment and gold, and escape the bank before lockdown.

\section{Genre \& Target Audience}

Heist is a multiplayer action party game, targeted at players ages 13 and above.

\section{Look and Feel}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/lookandfeel.jpg}
    \caption{Look and Feel}
\end{figure}

Heist will have a fun, arcadey, but still have a competitive side to it. It will be easy to pickup, with not much complexity to it, and a lot of intuitive mechanics. We will use a pixel low poly art style to represent the environment and the characters in the game. It will be a 4 player split screen game.

\section{Game Progression Summary}

Four thieves spawn at random at one of the four points of entry. In the first stage, their objective is to infiltrate the bank by getting past quicktime events to bypass traps and defenses. they must now move through the bank and try to sneak by other players or security drones. 

Their next objective is to get to the vault and obtain as much gold as possible and more then the next player to win. After they obtain as much gold as possible from the vault, they have to escape through the bank from a randomly chosen escape point in the bank before the lockdown timer expires or else they get stuck in the bank..

As the game progresses, there will be more defenses and drones in the bank to increase the challenge for the players. Games will generally last between 15-20 mins, depending on how quick the players get to the vault.

\chapter{Story and Setting}

\section{Story and Narrative}

Our setting is the Cinque National Bank (CNB), it is a prestigious and sophisticated bank frequented by the rich and known by thieves as a goldmine. Set in the near future, Cinque National Bank is notorious for their top of the line security and surveillance measures in addition to being loaded.  The bank is a complex building with a lot of hallways, rooms, and sections with state of the art defense and security mechanisms along with professional security drones. Although many thieves from all around the world have attempted to pull off heists, no one has been successful, so far. This time, however, four thieves plan to perform the biggest heist in history at Cinque National Bank, but little do they know, they are all there on the same night.

\section{Game World}

The game world is set in one of the world’s richest and most prestigious banks in the world. Of course, you are entering the banks in its off-hours when the defenses and the drones have been deployed to fend off any potential intruders. 

The main floor of the bank is going to clearly represent the prestige through its clean and modern look. It will contain the teller area, offices, meeting rooms, and bathrooms. 

The basement will be a contrasting environment to the main floor, as it will have bare concrete walls, visible pipes and valves, and exposed lights. It will contain the vault, maintenance offices, and pump rooms.

\chapter{Levels}

\section{Main Floor}

\subsection{Synopsis}

Cinque National Bank is one of the biggest banks in Europe, and is highly prestigious. The Ground Floor is the starting point for all characters. It contains the player spawn points. After spawning here, the players will attempt to find the stairs and go to the basement in order to find the vault. This floor has a lower number of pickups and obstacles than the Basement Floor. There are defended set around, but fewer in comparison to the lower level of the bank. The map is viewed in a top-down, Isometric angle. The rooms present are offices, lobbies, meeting rooms, and bathrooms. They are all connected through a series of long hallways that will be filled with defenses and drones.

There are multiple ways to go through the bank. Cinque National Bank has a very nonlinear layout with multiple staircases, rooms, exits and long hallways. The players must decide the optimal route that allows them to either avoid drones and other players, or find weapons and attack them head on. If necessary, they can even travel back and forth between the two floors. The final destination for most will be the heavily guarded vault, but the route taken to get there is entirely up to the player. 

\subsection{Map}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{images/Ground2.png}
    \caption{Ground Floor Map}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Primary Path}

\textcolor{blue}{(Shown in Blue)} The player spawns and makes their way directly down the stairs to the vault. This way is the fastest, but the players miss out on valuable pickups.

\subsubsection{Secondary Path}

\textcolor{magenta}{(Shown in Magenta)} The player spawns and looks around the bank for pickups. This way they gain an advantage against other players and drones, but it is not as fast as just going to the ground floor.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Encounters}

The player will encounter various challenges. The drones will attempt to stun them, and other players will be trying to prevent them from making it to the vault. There will also be various types of hazards that will slow the player down. When not in an alerted state, the multiple Drones follow the yellow paths (Figure 4.4) in opposite directions. Once alerted to player presence, they will hunt down and attempt to stun the players before returning to the scheduled patrol area

\section{Basement}

\subsection{Synopsis}

The basement floor is accessible through the staircases on the first floor. The basement contains a large amount of pickups and hazards - far more than the first floor. The vault is also located in the center of the basement. The players must go here to get the gold. The floor is viewed in a top-down, Isometric angle. The rooms present are security rooms, more offices, storage rooms, and server rooms, in addition to the large gold vault.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Primary Path}

(Shown in Blue) The player gets down the stairs and immediately makes their way to the vault. This way is the fastest, but the players miss out on valuable pickups around the basement.

\subsubsection{Secondary Path}

(Shown in Magenta) The player gets down the stairs and looks around the basement for pickups. This way they gain an advantage against other players and drones, but it is not as fast as just going to the vault.

\subsection{Encounters}

The player will encounter various challenges. The drones will attempt to stun them, and other players will be trying to prevent them from making it to the vault. There will also be various types of hazards that will slow the player down. There will be far more hazards and drones in the basement. When not in an alerted state, the multiple Drones follow the yellow paths (Figure 4.7) in opposite directions. Once alerted to player presence, they will hunt down and attempt to stun the players before returning to the scheduled patrol area

\section{Mechanics}

\subsection{Movement}

Players will be able to walk, crouch and dash. Each of the movement states will give out a different detection radius (crouch is the lowest, dash is the highest) which will be picked up by the drones in the area. Dash will have a short cooldown.

        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Players/Drones drop gold when damaged/stunned. Players will need to have gold in their inventory to drop any.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 20  for each attack taken
        \item 200 for stun
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Artificial Intelligence}

\section{Enemy AI}

\subsection{Drones}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Patrols a set path until alerted and returns to the path once threat level returns to zero
    \item If it is alerted by a sound, the threat level becomes one and attempts to find the source of the sound
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It will go to the place the sound originated at, and once there begin a patrol of the area. Once patrol is complete and it doesn’t see anything, it’s threat level returns to zero and resumes it initial patrol.
    \end{itemize}
    \item If it sees a player, its threat level goes to two and attempts to follow and stun the player.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If it loses site of the player for 5 secs, the threat level becomes one, and it will begin to patrol the area.
        \item If the drone successfully stuns the player, it will pick up a portion of gold (if dropped) and return it to the vault. Once the gold has been returned, the threat level returns to zero and the initial patrol is resumed.
    \end{itemize}
    \item If the drone, while following or patrolling an area, moves beyond a set distance from its original patrol, it will disengage, set its threat level to zero and return to its original patrol.
    \item Once the lockdown has been activated, the drones will begin threat level three, where their patrol distance is increased and their speed is increased.    
\end{itemize}

\section{Pathfinding}

Uses the default Unity Navmesh Agent, setting the focused player’s as the Drone’s target. When returning to the vault all players are swapped to obstacles with width wide enough to block the hallway, so the drone’s pathfinding will avoid them.

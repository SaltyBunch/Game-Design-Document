\chapter{Game Overview}

\section{Game Concept}

Play as one of the four thieves attempting a heist on the Cinque National Bank. Players must infiltrate the bank, which is rigged with traps and hazards to challenge the player. Security Drones patrol the bank and will engage in combat with players if detected. Players will be able to use weapons and traps that are available as pickups across the map to engage in combat with other players or the drone. The main objective of the player is to reach the vault, then collect as much gold as possible from it, and then escape before the lockdown timer reaches zero. Player that escapes with the most gold possible wins, players who do not manage to escape before lockdown are not awarded points.

\section{Setting}

The game is set in the near future at the biggest bank in Europe, the Cinque National Bank. It is equipped with state-of-art defense technology, and is one of the most prestigious banks in the world.

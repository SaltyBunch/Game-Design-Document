\chapter{Story and Setting}

\section{Story and Narrative}

Our setting is the Cinque National Bank (CNB), it is a prestigious and sophisticated bank frequented by the rich and known by thieves as a goldmine. Set in the near future, Cinque National Bank is notorious for their top of the line security and surveillance measures in addition to being loaded.  The bank is a complex building with a lot of hallways, rooms, and sections with state of the art defense and security mechanisms along with professional security drones. Although many thieves from all around the world have attempted to pull off heists, no one has been successful, so far. This time, however, four thieves plan to perform the biggest heist in history at Cinque National Bank, but little do they know, they are all there on the same night.

\subsection{Game Progression Summary}

Four thieves spawn at random at one of the four points of entry. In the first stage, their objective is to infiltrate the bank by getting past quicktime events to bypass traps and hazards. Secondly, they must now move through the bank to not get spotted by other players or security drones. 
Their next objective is to get to the vault and obtain as much gold as possible and more then the next player to win. After they need to obtain as much gold as possible from the bank, they have to escape through the bank from a randomly chosen escape point in the bank before the lockdown timer expires and they get stuck in the bank.

\section{Cut Scenes}
